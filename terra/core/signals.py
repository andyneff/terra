'''
A "signal dispatcher" class which helps allow decoupled componets get notified
when actions occur elsewhere in the framework. In a nutshell, signals allow
certain senders to notify a set of receivers that some action has taken place.
They're especially useful when many pieces of code may be interested in the
same events.

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/signals/ for more info

        A function or an instance method which is to receive signals.
        Receivers must be hashable objects.
        If weak is True, then receiver must be weak referenceable.

        a Python object, or None to receive events from any sender.
    weak : bool
        Whether to use weak references to the receiver. By default, the
        module will attempt to use weak references to the receiver
        objects. If this parameter is false, then strong references will
        be used.
